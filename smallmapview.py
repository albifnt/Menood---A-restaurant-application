    """
    A customized MapView widget optimized for displaying a small area of interest.

    SmallMapView extends Kivy's MapView widget and is specifically tailored
    for scenarios where you need to display a focused or small geographical area
    within a map view. It inherits all the functionality of MapView and allows
    developers to control the viewport, zoom level, and markers displayed on the map.

    Use SmallMapView when your application needs to present a compact map view,
    such as displaying a detailed view of a neighborhood, a specific building,
    or any localized area of interest.
