    The WelcomeScreen class represents the initial screen displayed when the application starts.

    This screen typically serves as the entry point for users, providing essential
    information, options for login or signup, or a brief introduction to the application.
    It is often designed to create a welcoming experience and guide users into the main
    features or functionalities of the application.

    Developers can customize the WelcomeScreen by adding widgets, buttons, images, or
    interactive elements to enhance the user experience and encourage engagement.
