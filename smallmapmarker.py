class SmallMapMarker(MapMarker):
    """
    A customized map marker for displaying small markers on a map view.

    This class inherits from MapMarker, which is typically used in conjunction with
    a MapView widget to mark specific locations on a map. SmallMapMarker is specifically
    designed to display smaller markers compared to the default MapMarker.

    Use this class to represent points of interest, user locations, or any other 
    significant locations on a map that require a smaller visual footprint.
