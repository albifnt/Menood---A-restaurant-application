## Problems and difficulties faced.
<p align="justify">
Often, when in a new city, either traveling or for work, people have difficulties choosing a place to eat. 91% of Italians encounter difficulties when deciding where to have lunch or dinner. The causes of these difficulties vary, but the main one is certainly personal indecision. To help with the decision, 73.4% of Italians use online services like Google, Tripadvisor, The Fork, or social media. However, more than half state that they need additional information beyond what these services provide. In particular, nearly all of them believe that quickly viewing complete menus with prices and dish descriptions would facilitate their choice. To view the types of dishes and prices of a place, existing services often redirect to websites, which are not always available. This constant redirection to online sites makes the search slow and comparing places particularly difficult.

## Added Value this Idea Brings in Solving the Problem/Opportunity

The Menood service allows users to view complete menus with prices and dish descriptions with a simple click. Menood aims to resolve indecision in choosing a restaurant and to enhance the dining experience for its users. It is a platform that contains updated menus and offers instant translation of menus, ingredients, and various dish descriptions. Additionally, it features maps and restaurant locations and has the significant advantage of providing personalized recommendations tailored to the user's profile. Translating menus into the desired language can greatly facilitate reading for tourists visiting our country who do not speak our language.

The true innovation that Menood brings is its ability to provide personalized suggestions to its users. Through an initial questionnaire and continuous data acquisition, an intelligent algorithm can define the userâ€™s profile and identify culinary preferences, favorite types of restaurants, potential intolerances, allergies, and much more. By utilizing this wide array of data, Menood effectively resolves the indecision that we often experience when choosing a restaurant.
